# TimeStopper_ReactGame

A game built with React about stopping a clock as close to zero within a defined time limit.

Created on August 30, 2024.

This is my take on creating the Time Stopper Game from section 8 (refs and portal) of the Udemy react course, ["React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)"](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.
